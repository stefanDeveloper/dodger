## Getting Started

Just clone this repository and follow each guideline inside the corresponding application folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stefanDeveloper/dodger.git
```

In each of these folders you will find a `docker-compose.yml`, a `.env` file, as well as a `README.md` that describes some basics about this application.

In case you want to run applications individually, please make sure your Docker environment has a network called `proxy`. If this is not the case, please run:

```sh
docker network create proxy
```

## Ansible

Deploying made simple by applying Ansible Playbooks including hardening, installs and more!

### Getting Started

Create Python virtualenv and install requirements:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace your IP address in the `inventory.yml` and run the provided Ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook dodger_deploy.yml
```
